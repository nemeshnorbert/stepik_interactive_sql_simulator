Window functions all to perform advanced data aggregation
When using window functions one query executed as follows
    Step 1. Execute all clauses of the query, except ORDER BY and LIMIT and window functions themselves
    Step 2. Execture window functions

Window function clause syntax:
    <WINDOW_FUNCTION>(<EXPRESSION>) OVER (
        PARTITION_BY <COLUMN_A>, <COLUMN_B>, ...
        ORDER BY <COLUMN_X>, <COLUMN_Y>, ...
        ROWS BETWEEN <RANGE_BEGIN> AND <RANGE_END>
    )

The symantics of the window function is as follows
    Pick data D from step 1. Note: for each row r in D the value of <EXPRESSION> must be already available
    Group this data into partitions by <COLUMN_A>, <COLUMN_B>, ...
    For each partition p in partitions
        Order rows in p by <COLUMN_X>, <COLUMN_Y>, ...
        For each row r in p
            set up window w from <RANGE_BEGIN> to <RANGE_END> around r
            yield result of <WINDOW_FUNCTION> applied to the window of w of partition p at row r

Examples of window functions
    ROW_NUMBER() for each row return its position within partition
    RANK()       for each row return 1 + number of rows with ORDER BY key strictly less than the current row
    DENSE_RANK() for each row return 1 + number of OREDER BY keys strictly less than the current row
    LAG()        for each row return either previous row or NULL
    LEAD()       for each row return either next row or NULL

Any aggragte function can be a window function. It just computes its value based on the whole partition
and does not take into account the window and the row

Examples
    Select using LAG window function
        SELECT
            student_name,
            COUNT(DISTINCT step_id) AS Количество,
            LAG(COUNT(DISTINCT step_id)) OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT step_id) DESC)

        FROM
            student
                INNER JOIN step_student USING(student_id)
        WHERE
            result = "correct"
        GROUP BY
            student_name;

    Select using LAG window function with named window
        WITH
            get_rate_lesson(mod_id, stud, rate) AS (
                SELECT
                    module_id,
                    student_name,
                    COUNT(DISTINCT step_id)
                FROM
                    student
                        INNER JOIN step_student USING(student_id)
                        INNER JOIN step USING (step_id)
                        INNER JOIN lesson USING (lesson_id)
                WHERE
                    result = "correct"
                GROUP BY
                    module_id,
                    student_name
        )
        SELECT
            mod_id AS Модуль,
            stud AS Студент,
            rate AS Райтинг,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER module_history AS Номер,
            RANK() OVER module_history AS Ранг,
            DENSE_RANK() OVER module_history AS Рейтинг
        ROM
            get_rate_lesson
        WINDOW module_history AS (PARTITION BY mod_id ORDER BY  rate DESC)

Table declaration and creation
    Examples
        Create a simple table
            CREATE TABLE book (
                book_id INT,
                title VARCHAR(50),
                author VARCHAR(50),
                price DECIMAL(8, 2),
                amount INT
            );

        Create table with a primary key;
        key is automatically incremented every time a new row added into the table
            CREATE TABLE author(
                author_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
                name_author VARCHAR(50)
            );

        Create table with primary key and two foreign keys
            CREATE TABLE book (
                book_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
                amount INT,
                FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES author (author_id),
                FOREIGN KEY (genre_id) REFERENCES genre (genre_id)
            );

        Create table that deletes its row if respective row in the foreign table is deleted
            CREATE TABLE book (
                book_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
                amount INT,
                FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES author (author_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
            );

        Create table that sets to null the foreign key if respective row in the foreign table is deleted
            CREATE TABLE book (
                book_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
                amount INT,
                FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES author (author_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
            );

        Create table from a query
            CREATE TABLE
                ordering AS
            SELECT
                author,
                title,
                (SELECT ROUND(AVG(amount)) FROM book) AS amount
            FROM
                book
            WHERE
                amount < (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM book);

Table updates
    Examples
        Simple updates of tuples in a table
            UPDATE
                book
            SET
                price = 0.9 * price
            WHERE
                amount IN (5, 10);

        Simple updates of multiple columns
            UPDATE
                book
            SET
                buy = IF(buy > amount, amount, buy),
                price = IF(buy = 0, ROUND(price * 0.9, 2), price);

        Updates of multiple tables
            UPDATE
                book,
                supply
            SET
                book.amount = book.amount + supply.amount,
                book.price = (book.price + supply.price) / 2,
                supply.price = (book.price + supply.price) / 2
            WHERE
                book.title = supply.title AND book.author = supply.author;

        Update multiple tables using join
            UPDATE
                book
                    INNER JOIN author ON book.author_id = author.author_id
                    INNER JOIN supply ON supply.title = book.title AND supply.author = author.name_author
            SET
                book.amount = book.amount + supply.amount,
                supply.amount = 0,
                book.price = (book.amount * book.price + supply.amount * supply.price) / (book.amount + supply.amount)
            WHERE
                book.price != supply.price

        Update table using subqueries
            UPDATE book
            SET
                genre_id = (SELECT genre.genre_id FROM genre WHERE genre.name_genre = 'Поэзия')
            WHERE
                book.title = 'Стихотворения и поэмы';

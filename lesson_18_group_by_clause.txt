Data groupping and aggregation
    Examples
        Select data, group it by column and aggregate
            SELECT
                author AS Автор,
            FROM
                book
            GROUP BY
                author;

        Select unique values from the column
            SELECT
                author,
                DISTINCT title
            FROM
                book
            GROUP BY
                author;

        Select data, find sum and count for each group
            SELECT
                author AS Автор,
                COUNT(*) AS Различных_книг,
                SUM(amount) AS Количество_экземпляров
            FROM
                book
            GROUP BY
                author;

        Select data, find min, max and average for each group
            SELECT
                author,
                MIN(price) AS Минимальная_цена,
                MAX(price) AS Максимальная_цена,
                AVG(price) AS Средняя_цена
            FROM
                book
            GROUP BY
                author;

        Aggregate data from the whole table
            SELECT
                MIN(price) AS Минимальная_цена,
                MAX(price) AS Максимальная_цена,
                ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS Средняя_цена
            FROM
                book;

        Aggregate filtered data
            SELECT
                ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS Средняя_цена,
                ROUND(SUM(price * amount), 2) AS Стоимость
            FROM
                book
            WHERE
                amount BETWEEN 5 AND 14;

            SELECT
                book.author AS Author,
                COUNT(*) AS BooksCount,
                SUM(book.amount) AS ExamplarCount
            FROM

            GROUP BY
                book.author;

            SELECT
                book.author,
                MIN(book.price) AS MinPrice,
                MAX(book.price) AS MaxPrice,
                AVG(book.price) AS AVgPrice
            FROM

        Aggregate filtered data
            SELECT
                ROUND(AVG(book.price), 2) AS AvgPrice,

Select data from multiple tables
    Examples
        Select data from two tables, join tuples with equal value in genre_id column
            SELECT
                book.title,
                genre.name_genre,
                book.price

                    INNER JOIN genre ON book.genre_id = genre.genre_id
            WHERE
                book.amount > 8
            ORDER BY
                book.price DESC;

        Select data from two tables, for each tuple from the first table either join tuples from
        the second table with the same genre_id or join null
            SELECT
                genre.name_genre
            FROM
                genre
                    LEFT JOIN book ON genre.genre_id = book.genre_id
            WHERE
                book.book_id IS NULL;

        Select all possible pairs of tuples from two tables
            SELECT
                city.name_city,
                author.name_author,

            FROM
                city

            WHERE
                genre.name_genre LIKE '%роман%'
            ORDER BY
